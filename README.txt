Required Text: Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms 1st Edition by Shai
Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David, Cambridge University Press. ISBN: 978-1107512825.

Catalog Description: CSC 692 Knowledge Engineering Credits: (3-0) 3 Cr. A systematic study of the
theory and algorithms that constitute machine learning. It covers learning based on examples including
genetic algorithms, case-based reasoning, decision trees, and Bayesian methods.

Instructional method: CSC 692 is Graduate computer science course comprised of an introduction to
Machine Learning. CSC 315 (Data Structures) is recommended for this course.
    This class will be conducted completely online. The class will meet together via Zoom at the scheduled
class time of 12:00 – 12:50 on Monday/Wednesday/Friday. The class sessions will be recorded and made
available for students who are unable to attend in person now and then, but attendance is expected and will
be recorded by the instructor. This course will be presented as lectures with significant class participation
required. The material will be primarily be derived from the text. Material outside the text may be used to
enhance the text and web references might be given in class. There will be a few days where students will
work in groups and it is possible that some class days will be spent in a computer lab. Your assignments
and exams will be conducted through D2L. Students should be prepared by reading the corresponding text
material before the coverage of the material in class and it is likely students will need to read the same
material after class.


                                                     1
It is very important that students keep up with homework assignments and it is expected that students spend
at least 2 hours of study for every hour in class, which agrees with the guidelines of the undergraduate
catalog (Section 2.32, subsection 2.B.2 in the SD BOR Policies and Procedures.
     Notes: Students enrolled in this course will be held to a higher standard than those
enrolled in CSC-448, even if the meeting time is the same. This will include but not be limited to different
assignment and different exam questions.

Outline of Topics:


      •   Part I:            Introduction and Foundations
      •   Part II:           Models, Selection and Validation
      •   Part III:          Methods, From Theory to Algorithm

   FINAL EXAMINATION [Project|Cumulative Take-home] – Due 12/2 at 2:50 p.m..

Class attendance is required for all courses at SDSM&T. You are responsible for the lecture material as
well as any assigned readings. Lecture material may diverge significantly from the assigned readings, so
good attendance is particularly important in this class. Excessive absence may make it difficult for students
to achieve expected levels of performance.

Course Objectives: The primary object is to introduce the student to machine learning, and the algorithmic
paradigms through an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning
and the mathematical derivation that transforms these principles into practical algorithms. This will include,
but is not limited to, discussions about the computational complexity, stability, and important algorithmic
paradigms such as stochastic gradient decent, neural networks, and structured output learning.

Course Outcomes: A student who successfully completes this course should, at a minimum, be able to:

   1. Explain the goals of machine learning and machine intelligence,
   2. describe and apply algorithmic paradigms such as gradient decent, decision trees, neural networks
      and Bayesian methods etc.,
   3. discuss the computational complexity and stability of said algorithms,
   4. develop programs that implements the ideas and algorithms discussed,
   5. demonstrate an understanding of some of the standard machine learning algorithms used for super-
      vised and unsupervised learning.

Grading:
    Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the semester based on the weighted scoring system outlined
above. Note that the project and homework have significant impact upon your final grade. To pass the course
you must successfully complete these assignments as well as pass the exams. The grades will be assigned
as follows:
                                                          A     93.0 to 100
                                                          B     83.0 to 92.9
                                                          C     73.0 to 82.9
                                                          D     63.0 to 72.9
                                                          F     < 63.0




                                                                 4
    There is no late policy in this class. All assignments must be turned in by the due date, otherwise they
will not be accepted. To receive full credit programs must not only be correct but must adhere to good pro-
gramming style guidelines (standard formatting, meaningful identifiers, modular code, good documentation,
etc.), and the documentation needs to be a document that stands by it itself (i.e. the reader will NOT need
access to the code to understand how the program and the code works.).

Makeups: Makeup exams will be given ONLY if the student calls the Computer Science and Engineering
office at 394-2722 BEFORE the exam is scheduled to begin and has a legitimate reason. Leave your name,
message and time of call on the answering machine if the office is closed. If you must miss a test for a
legitimate reason, I will gladly give you a makeup. If you miss a test without a legitimate reason, I will
gladly give you a zero. Please do not be offended if I ask you for documentation for an excused absence.

Academic Honesty and Integrity:
    All students will be held to the institutional standard for academic honesty and integrity. The following
are the relevant sections taken from the student handbook (Section 3.4, Category C, subsection 2.1 in the SD
Policies and Procedures): Acts of academic dishonesty will include, but are not limited to, the following:

   • Cheating, which is defined as, but not limited to, the following:
         – Use or giving of any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations;
         – Use of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing reports,
           solving problems, or carrying out other assignments; or
         – Acquisition, without permission, of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of
           the institutional faculty or staff.
   • Plagiarism, which is defined as, but is not limited to, the following:
         – The use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another per-
           son without full and clear acknowledgment consistent with accepted practices of the discipline;
         – The unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person agency engaged in the selling
           of term papers or other academic materials.
   • Other forms of dishonesty relating to academic achievement, research results or academically related
     public service;
   • Furnishing information known or believed to be false to any institutional official, faculty member or
     office;
   • misrepresentations of degrees awarded or honors received;

Penalties for violating the academic integrity of the course may range for requiring the student to repeat the
work in question to the assignment of a failing grade in the course.

Copyright and Terms of Use: All the material authored by the faculty member is for class use only. This
means you can use the classroom materials for your personal use related to learning the subject and you can
retain this material for your own personal use and reference later. Lectures, presentations, and other course
materials are protected intellectual property under South Dakota Board of Regents Policy. Accordingly,
recording and disseminating lectures, presentations or course materials is strictly prohibited without the
express permission of the faculty member. Violation of this prohibition may result in the student being
subject to Student Conduct proceedings under SDBOR Policy 3:4.




                                                      5
Disruptive Behavior: The Student Handbook prohibits the disruption or obstruction of teaching. (Section
3.4, Category C, subsection 2.2 in the SD BOR Policies and Procedures) Activities that are disruptive and/or
obstructive to teaching will include, but are not limited to, the following:

   1. Showing up late to class. While it is understandable that a student might be a few minutes late to
      class there is a limit to how late one can be. As a general rule, it is acceptable for a person that is less
      than 10 minutes late to enter class. I would like to ask a student that is more than 10 minutes late to
      class to refrain from entering class. The student can catch me after class if they need to see me.
   2. Eating in class. A student’s schedule often has classes that overlap their lunch hour, or doesn’t leave
      time to eat during the day. Please refrain from eating during class. Those with medical conditions that
      require special accommodations are certainly welcome to speak with me.
   3. No text messaging during class.
   4. Electronic noises from Cell Phones, Pagers, PDA’a, computers, or associated electronics will not
      be tolerated.


Freedom in learning: Under Board of Regents and University policy student academic performance may
be evaluated solely on an academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic stan-
dards. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study
and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any
course of study for which they are enrolled. Students who believe that an academic evaluation reflects prej-
udiced or capricious consideration of student opinions or conduct unrelated to academic standards should
contact the dean of the college which offers the class to initiate a review of the evaluation.

ADA Statement: SD Mines strives to ensure that physical resources, as well as information and commu-
nication technologies, are reasonably accessible to users in order to provide equal access to all. If you
encounter any accessibility issues, you are encouraged to immediately contact the instructor of the course
and the Title IX and Disability Coordinator, Ms. Amanda Lopez at disabilityservices@sdsmt.edu or 394-
2533. Students with special needs or requiring special accommodations should also contact the instructor
and the Title IX and Disability Coordinator. More information can be found at ADA Services.
    Any ADA arrangements that are used for an exam must be finalized at least one week before the testing
date. It is the student’s responsibility to

   • contact the instructor for the course and inform the instructor what special ADA arrangements are
     requested
   • make sure that the appropriate documentation from the ADA office validating the request has been
     provided to the instructor.

Upon being contacted by the student, the instructor and student will work together to find a suitable arrange-
ment. The department has a time and reserved room for ADA exams, and this arrangement may include the
possibility of the instructor requiring the student to use these accommodations. Since this arrangement must
be finalized at least one week before the testing date, the student is advised to contact the instructor well in
advance of the week before the test.




                                                        6
Title IX: Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 is the federal law prohibiting discrimination
based on sex under any education program and/or activity operated by an institution receiving and/or ben-
efiting from federal financial assistance. Behaviors that can be considered “sexual discrimination” include
sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, relationship abuse (dating violence and domestic violence), sex-
ual misconduct, and gender discrimination. You are encouraged to report these behaviors. SD Mines can
better support you as a student if we know about what is happening. Reporting also helps us to identify pat-
terns that might arise – for example, if more than one complainant reports having been assaulted or harassed
by the same individual. SD Mines is committed to providing a safe and positive learning experience. To
report a violation of sexual misconduct or gender discrimination, please contact the Title IX Coordinator,
Amanda Lopez, at 605-394-2533 or submit an online report at TitleIX. Please note that as your professor,
I am required to report any incidences to the Title IX Coordinator. Confidential support for students is
available by contacting the Student Counseling Center at 605-394-1924 or counseling@sdsmt.edu

Electronic Devices Policy: The Tablet PC program is meant to provide a tool that will enhance student
learning. It is expected that you will make appropriate in class use of the Tablet PC, which means the Tablet
PC should be used on tasks relevant to the current classroom activities, such as,

   • Taking Notes (You should have access to OneNote & Windows Journal)
   • Using other software as called for in class by the instructor.
   • During synchronous Zoom sessions, please ensure that you are logged in and participating. Please
     refrain from using other devices that will distract you. Please keep outside disruptions to a mini-
     mum—although we may get to see one another’s pets, children, etc. Use your Zoom microphone and
     video controls as needed to prevent outside distractions from disturbing your colleagues.

If you have the desire to use the Tablet PC to take notes then you must take notes with your stylus and your
screen must be in the locked down mode.
Note: Failure of a student to appropriately use their Tablet PC in class will result in suspension of Tablet PC
usage during class.

Tablet PC Help:

   • The first and best place to go if you need help (technical or software) with your tablet PC is the
     Circulation Desk of the library.
   • The friendly folks there will answer questions, checkout rental tablets, and do whatever it takes to get
     you the help you need.
   • The Tablet PC repair shop is on the lower level of the library (just down the stairs from the Circulation
     Desk and right next to the Tech Learning Center). You may be sent down there by the folks at the
     front desk.
   • So, whether you are a student or a faculty or staff member, the front desk of the library is where you
     go for help with your tablet PC. The number is 394-2418.

COVID-19 Statement
Mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is everyone’s responsibility. In order to ensure your health and safety
and that of the entire campus community, please monitor your health daily and abide by the following
protocols:

   • If you are exposed to COVID-19, develop COVID-19 symptoms, or anticipate being absent for more
     than two weeks due to COVID-19, communicate your circumstances immediately via deanofstu-
     dents@sdmst.edu. The Dean of Students office will communicate with your instructor(s) and provide
     appropriate University communication to impacted parties while also preserving privacy.

   • If you miss class due to medical reason, please inform your instructor(s) in a timely fashion.

   • If you have been told to isolate or quarantine, you cannot attend classes in person. You should ask
     your instructor(s) about options for remote participation. Your instructor(s) will work with you to
     determine whether remote participation, an incomplete grade, or withdrawal is most appropriate.

Thank you for following these important measures to keep our community healthy and safe.

COVID-19 Attendance Policy
Out of an abundance of caution, you should contact the Dean of Students office at deanofstudents@sdmst.edu
if you are ill or injured and are not able to engage in course work. The Dean of Students will contact your
instructor(s). Any make-up of course requirements missed shall be worked out between you and your in-
structor(s). Your responsibility is to follow up with your instructor(s) quickly. Instructor(s) will respond
with the aim of being flexible while retaining the integrity of your academic experience. Even if your ab-
sence has not been validated by the Dean of Students, instructors are required to allow for such make-up in
a timely manner. You, on the other hand, are required to remain in timely contact with your instructor(s) to
the greatest degree possible. Failure to communicate quickly and follow up my result in your inability to
complete your semester.

COVID-19 Face Covering Policy
Under the COVID-19 Face Covering Protocol approved by the South Dakota Board of Regents, SD Mines
begins the fall term at Level 3, which requires face coverings in all public indoor spaces on campus. If you
come to class not wearing an appropriate face covering, you will be asked to put one on. If supplies exist,
a disposable mask will be provided if you do not have one. If no mask is available, you will be advised
about virtual education options under the Informal Correction process in the COVID-19 Face Covering
Protocol. If you decline to wear a face covering and do not leave the classroom, you will be referred
to the Dean of Students for Formal Correction under the COVID-19 Face Covering Protocol, which may
include noncompliance with the Student Code of Conduct. Your instructor(s) may be required to provide
virtual options for you to continue to participate in the course until the allegations against you of non-
compliance are resolved. Students who repeatedly come to class without a face covering will be subject to
the consequences outlined in the COVID-19 Face Covering Protocol.

Class rules:

What NOT to do:

   • Do not arrive late. It is best to have a seat by 5 mins prior to the hour. Learn how long you’ll need to
     find parking and/or walk to class at the start of the semester.
   • Do not leave early. Do not start to pack up your notes and books prior to 10 before the hour, unless
     we’re clearly finished with class early. Exceptions: if you let me know before class that you will need
     to leave, or you have a genuine emergency.
   • Do not talk to other students in class while I’m lecturing. If someone else around you talks too much,
     please let me know!
   • Do not attend to paperwork, homework, or other work that distracts from listening to the lecture.
   • Do not eat or chew gum in class. Safely sealed drinks (e.g. coffee cups with lids or water bottles) are
     OK to bring.
   • Do not read papers, listen to music or surf the web in class.
   • Do not wear hats, caps, or sunglasses in class.
   • Turn off mobile phones when in class. Nobody else wants to hear your phone. If your phone rings, I
     will answer it, and you will probably be embarrassed. Exceptions: if you must remain available for a
     child or other dependent, please let me know in advance, and get a phone with a silent vibrating call
     alert.
   • Do not come to class if you are too tired, ill, injured, depressed, hung over, etc. to pay attention
     properly. Get your rest and stay healthy. Come to class well-fed with a decent meal that will not
     make you suffer a hypoglycemic blood sugar crash half-way through class. Your brain needs a good,
     steady supply of protein and complex carbohydrates. SDSMT is not free. Why waste the money by
     not getting much as you can out of lecture?

What to do:

   • Be prepared. Read the text before class.
   • Stay focused. Don’t bring in the other worries and distractions offline. You can’t solve them while
     you are in class, so you might as well focus.
   • Be inquiring. Keep ”what”, ”how” and ”why” in your head and ask questions. Search for additional
     sources on the web.
   • Follow a schedule. This will keep you consistent and reduce the pretest panic.
   • Be proactive. Start on projects right when they are assigned, even if you are very busy. Organize a
     study group.
   • Take notes. Decide before class start how you plan to do this. Get the supplies prior to class. Notes
     don’t have to be extensive to be useful. They are not a transcription of the lecture; but a short hand
     to remember the lecture. The text contains the details, so sparse notes allow for thinking during the
     lecture.
   • Take care of yourself. Exercise and real food [not fast or fried food] will make a difference in long
     term performance.
   • If you are a parent: If you need to bring a baby or young child to class occasionally, that’s ok, but
     please see me as soon as possible. I try to run a family-friendly class, and will make every effort to
     accommodate you, but we must also reach agreement about what to do if the child disrupts the class
     too much.
